# ExpertsCombination

Combining the feedback of multiple users on the relevance of coefficients in **”small n, large p”** linear regression is beneficial in preventing overfitting in machine learning applications where the number of training samples is too small and the number of dimensions is too large. 

This MATLAB code is used to test our two proposed methods (Majority Vote, and Field Focused Feedback) to combine experts feedback for feature selection in a synthetic setting, and a model to calculate the accuracy of the combined vote.
